This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js, Express, and EJS.
It allows users to:

Create new posts with a username and content

Read posts in a feed or detailed view

Update existing posts by editing content

Delete posts permanently

The app uses UUID for unique post IDs and method-override to handle HTTP methods like PATCH and DELETE.
It‚Äôs a beginner-friendly project to understand how CRUD operations work in a full-stack web application.
